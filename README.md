# NewsApp üóûÔ∏è
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](https://github.com/AkshayChordiya//blob/master/LICENSE)

The news app is based upon [NewsSampleMVVM](https://github.com/AkshayChordiya/android-arch-news-sample) but showcases MVI architecture pattern
combined with power of [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) and [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), thanks to [Roxie library](https://github.com/ww-tech/roxie)

## What's the app about?
It's a simple news app üóûÔ∏èwhich uses [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch top news headlines from the API.
The main aim of this app is to show how MVI helps in managing state combined with power of [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) and [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) to make our lives easier. 

The idea is to add new features With time to build a full-fledge app while making it easier to understand the codebase.

## Steps to run üèÉ
- Go to [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and generate an API key (It's only 2 steps!)
- Create new file -> `credentials.properties`
- Add the API key as shown below:
`
NEWS_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
`
- Build and run the app
- Enjoyyyyy üéâ

## Components used
- Architecture Components [ViewModel, LiveData, Lifecycle]
- Roxie library for MVI implementation
- Dagger for Dependency Injection

## Dependency Graph üî™

The following diagram shows the dependecy graph of the app.

## Architecture

The app uses **uni-directional** flow of state of the app<sup>1</sup> to have predictable **state machine** style architecture. It's inspired by MVVM and MVI hence it uses the following MVVM architecture while leveraging state management with MVI.

## Data flow<sup>1</sup>

The uni-directional pipeline for the flow of state.

## Testing

Super important and all the test cases will come soon.
